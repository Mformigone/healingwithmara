    <h1>Healing With Mara</h1>
    <div class="about">
        <p>I’m Mara — a woman who’s walked through fire, sat with silence, and still chose to rise.</p>

        <p><em>Healing With Mara</em> was never about pretending to be healed. It’s about choosing healing — over and over again — even when it’s slow, even when it’s messy, even when it feels like the world expects you to already be okay.</p>

        <p>My story is woven with moments of heartbreak, abandonment, and starting over. I know what it’s like to hold everything together for everyone else while quietly unraveling inside. I know what it’s like to carry pain that has no name — and still show up. Still love. Still believe.</p>

        <p>But I also know the quiet power of healing — not the kind that erases your past, but the kind that holds it gently and says: <strong>You made it. And you’re still becoming.</strong></p>

        <p>Here, I offer more than just words. I offer space — to feel, to breathe, to reconnect with who you truly are beneath the noise and expectations. Whether you’re a mother, a survivor, a seeker, or simply someone longing for peace, this space is for you.</p>

        <p>Through faith, reflection, and real, grounded support, <em>Healing With Mara</em> is a place to soften. To rebuild. To remember that your story isn’t over — in fact, it may just be beginning.</p>

        <p><strong>You don’t have to have it all figured out to begin again.</strong></p>

        <p>Come as you are. I’ll meet you there.</p>

        <p style="text-align: right;"><strong>With love,</strong><br>Mara</p>
